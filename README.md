Angular Font-Selector
=====================

A fontselect directive for AngularJS


Building
--------

We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for building and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) for testing.  
Before you can use the `grunt` command you need to install our
npm package dependencies and bower components by executing

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

Then you should be able to execute the following commands:

__Complete build:__ `grunt`

__All tests without build:__ `grunt test`

__Watch and test headless on every file change:__ `grunt watch:start`
